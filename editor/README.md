This directory contains list of directories, each corresponding
to a particular text editor, IDE or list of editors separated by `_`
that `Tokudae` provides utilities for.
<br>
If you do not see your editor on this list, then you are out of luck.
<br>
In case you have made some utilities or wish to include a utility for the
text editor of your choice in the next or the current `Tokudae` distribution,
then open the issue on the [github](https://github.com/b-jure/Tokudae) where
the official git repository is being hosted.
